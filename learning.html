        <p>Things I'm Currently Learning about
		<ul>
			<li>Capitals of the world-something I felt I should know. Has made me aware of many countries I had never even heard of in my America-centric view of the world.</li>
			<li>Art-Until going to college, I was never too interested in art. I took ART 101 and started to appreciate art. Now I'm learning what at least one person deemed the 100 most famous paintings. After this, I hope to branch out into other art forms. Please contact me if you have any recommendations!</li>
			<li>Wine-Once I graduated from college, I decided to become more refined in my alcohol taste. That starts with wine. I plan on joining a wine club and attending some wine tastings along my way to connesseiourship.</li>
			<li>Cooking-This one's out of necessity. I can't cook. I need to eat.</li>
			<li>Life-A lot to learn about this journey. I try to read religious and philosophical works and learn from experience. Text me if you can help</li>
		</ul>
